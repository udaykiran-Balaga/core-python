# Type Conversion in python

python defines type conversion functions to directly convert one data type to another which is useful in day-to-day competitive programming.

This type conversion is done using type conversion functions provided by python built-ins module.

`1. int()`

`2. float()`

`3. complex()`

`4. bool()`

`5. str()`

# int() function:

This function is used to perform following conversions.

`int to int`

`float to int`

`bool to int`

`string to int`

## syntax
```
syntax: int([value/variable])
```

# float() function:

This function is used to perform the following conversiions

`1. float to float`

`2. int to float`

`3. bool to float`

`4. string to float`

```
syntax:flaot([value/variable/expression])

```

# complex function:

This function is used to perform the following conversions

`1.	Complex to complex`

`2.	Int to complex`

`3.	Float to complex`

`4.	Bool to complex`

`5.	String to complex`


## syntax

```
Syntax1: complex(real = 0.0,imag = 0.0)

Syntax2: complex(complex)

```

# bool()

This function is used to perform the following conversions

`1.	Bool to bool`

`2.	Int to bool`

`3.	Float to bool`

`4.	Complex to bool`

`5.	Str to bool`

# str()

This function is used to perform the following conversions

`1.	Str to str`

`2.	Int to str`

`3.	Float to str`

`4.	Complex to str`

`5.	Bool to string`

## syntax

```
Syntax:str([value])

```
