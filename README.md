## INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON

## WHAT IS PYTHON?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Python's syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, making it a great choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

## HISTORY OF PYTHON
- Python, a programming language, was conceived in the 1980s and its development began in 1989. 
- The first version of Python was released in 1991. It was developed at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the 
  Netherlands. 
- Python was created in the C programming language to address the shortcomings of the ABC language. 
- Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum led the development of Python. 
- The name "Python" was inspired by the British comedy series "Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus" broadcast on BBC.

Python was developed by incorporating features from various other programming languages:

- C: Procedural Oriented Programming

- C++: Object-Oriented Programming

- Modula: Modular Programming

- Perl: Scripting Language
