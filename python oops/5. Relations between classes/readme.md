Composition, aggregation, and inheritance are fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They fall under the category of relationships between classes and are often discussed in the context of class design and modeling. Here's where they fit:

1. Composition

Topic: Class Relationships

Description:

A class is made up of one or more objects of other classes as part of its attributes.

Indicates a "has-a" relationship, where one class contains another as part of its functionality.

Example:

A Car class contains an Engine object. If the car is destroyed, the engine is also destroyed.

2. Aggregation

Topic: Class Relationships

Description:

A specialized form of association that represents a "whole-part" relationship, where the part can exist independently of the whole.
Also indicates a "has-a" relationship but is weaker than composition.

Example:

A Library contains multiple Book objects, but the books can exist even if the library is closed.

3. Inheritance
   
Topic: Reusability and Hierarchies in OOP

Description:

A mechanism where one class (child or subclass) inherits attributes and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent or superclass).

Indicates an "is-a" relationship.

Example:

A Dog class inherits from an Animal class because a dog is a type of animal.
