# Structure of writing python program

- python is a multi paradigm programming language.

- In python we can write programs using different programming approaches or paradigms.

   1. Procedural Oriented programming
   
   2. Object Oriented programming
   
   3. Unstructured programming

-In procedural oriented programming instructions are organized inside functions.

-In Object oriented programming instructions are origanized inside classes.

-In unstructured programming instructions are orgainzed without using  functions or classes, those are organized in sequential order.

# Document Section or Comments in python

-Documentation is information about program.

-Documentation is not instructions.

-This documentation is provided using comments

-There should be any space at the beginning of the statement.
